## Kylie Smith

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

Kylie Smith is a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">Department of Government</a> at the <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/">University of Texas at Austin</a>. With subfields in International Relations and Comparative Govenrnment, my research interests lie in the space between conflict and post-conflict studies. My primary research interest is violent non-state actors (VNSOs) and the institutions they build before and after peace agreements. 

Prior to coming to the University of Texas at Austin, I recieved my B.A. in the Honors College at Baylor University and my M.A. in Violence, Terrorism, and Security at the Queen's University Belfast. I am currently also a researcher for the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (<a href="https://acleddata.com/">ACLED</a>) primarily conducting research in the central region of the United States of America. I am a member of the Conflict Research Society, as well as Phi Beta Kappa. 

### Research Interests 
<div class="box">
  <p>
  My research agenda lies at the intersection of conflict, security, and governance, with an emphasis on violent non-state actors (VNSOs) and post-conflict institutions. I research how VNSOs come to peace agreements, operate following peace agreements, and build instiutions both befoere and after peace agreements. I am currently working on a project involving post-ceasefire recruitment of VNSOs.
