<b>Welcome!</b> I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">Department of Government</a> at the <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/">University of Texas at Austin</a>. 
With subfields in International Relations and Comparative Government, my research interests lie in the space between conflict and post-conflict studies. 
My primary research interests center on violent non-state actors (VNSOs) and the institutions they build before and after peace agreements. <br>
Prior to coming to the University of Texas at Austin, I received my B.A. in the Honors College at Baylor University and my M.A. in Violence, Terrorism, and Security at the Queen's University Belfast. 
I was an intern for the U.S. Department of State, serving as the Political and Economic Intern for the US Consulate in Shenyang, China, during which I conducted my research on Chinese domestic talent retention policies.
I am currently a researcher for the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (<a href="https://acleddata.com/">ACLED</a>) primarily conducting research in the central region of the United States of America. 
I am a member of the Conflict Research Society, as well as Phi Beta Kappa. 
  <p>
My research agenda lies at the intersection of conflict, security, and governance, with an emphasis on violent non-state actors (VNSOs) and post-conflict institutions. 
I research how VNSOs come to peace agreements, operate following peace agreements, and build institutions both before and after peace agreements. 
I am currently working on a project involving post-ceasefire recruitment of VNSOs.
