<b>Welcome!</b> My name is Kylie Smith (she/her/hers), and I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">Department of Government</a> at the <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/government/">University of Texas at Austin</a>. 
I specialize in International Relations and Political Methodology. My research examines how armed groups evolve after war and how their post-conflict trajectories shape governance, security, and political order. <br>
	<p>

My primary research focuses on violent non-state actors (VNSOs), including rebel groups, pro-government militias, and community defense forces. 
I am particularly interested in how these organizations adapt following conflict termination--whether they dissolve, persist peacefully, or remobilize--and the institutional legacies they leave behind. 
Across projects, I study how organizational structure, wartime ties to the state, and post-conflict political opportunities influence patterns of violence, restraint, and reintegration.

	</p>
Prior to joining UT Austin, I received my B.A. from the Honors College at Baylor University and my M.A. in Violence, Terrorism, and Security from Queen’s University Belfast. 
I am also a researcher with the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (<a href="https://acleddata.com/">ACLED</a>), where I primarily conduct research on political violence in the central region of the United States.
  
	<p>
My dissertation, Now What? Patterns of Violence and Organizational Change in Post-Conflict Armed Groups, consists of three linked projects that examine distinct post-war pathways: organizational termination, peaceful persistence through community brokerage, and remobilization following political shocks. 
Methodologically, I combine survival analysis, Bayesian hierarchical models, difference-in-differences designs, and qualitative evidence from historical and fieldwork-based case studies. 
I am currently working on projects related to post-ceasefire organizational behavior and recruitment dynamics among armed groups.
