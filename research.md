### Research Interests 
<div class="box">
  <p>
  My research agenda lies at the intersection of conflict, security, and governance, with an emphasis on violent non-state actors (VNSOs) and post-conflict institutions. I research how VNSOs come to peace agreements, operate following peace agreements, and build instiutions both befoere and after peace agreements. I am currently working on a project involving post-ceasefire recruitment of VNSOs.
